\section*{Introduction} 
1. State your main research problem motivating the research (one sentence)
Injury Surveillance is the axcasd. Så skriver jeg kort intro til surveillance i Sri Lanka idag. 
\\ \\
Sri Lanka is a south-asian country located on a island south of India. Diverse country with asdasdxczxd dasd asd asd asd sad asd asd. Konflikt -> Norsk fredsarbeid. Politiske situasjonen idag
Norsk bistand idag og situasjonen nå. 


\section*{Research question}
% 2. State your main research question addressing the problem (one sentence)
\emph{How to improve data-collection for injury surveillance using web-based forms in low/middle income countries}
The research question needs to be discussed in detail. What does improve really mean? Using Sri Lanka as a case study \\

\subsection*{Injury Surveillance}
Define injury surveillance. Referer to WHO and so on.

\subsection*{Improvement of data-collection} 
What is the improvement and how can  we measure it. We must keep in mind the overall goal of injury surveillance which is to collect statisticts so that the health authories and goverment can issue tiltak. Therefore it is clear that an improvement must be to better the quality of injury surveillence statistics. To understand how we can improve the statistics we neeed to understand the situation today. How many of injuries are reported, and what is the data quality of the data actually reported? \\
Talking to people at the hospital makes it clear that the issue today is that the existing data-collection tool, a paper form, is very tideous for the nurses to use. The main issuse is that it takes alot of time to fill out one form, and the data clerks does not have enough time to cover all the patients. By speeding up the time used per patient, data empirical data for the injury surveillance is improved.

\subsection*{Web-based forms}

\subsection*{Low/Middle income countries}
Define them. compare to norway. Talk about Sri Lanka as a case study

 

\section*{Research method}
The research method is the strategy of how to find empirical data about the world. Something about GI leaning towards the phenomenological paradigm.
\subsection{Ressearch goal}
How should we measure if the improvement was successfull?
3. Define the key concept used in the thesis (one sentence)

4. State your unit of analysis and empirical setting (one sentence)

5. State your research approach/method (one sentence)

6. State your main (expected) contribution (one sentence)

7. Write a title that communicates the essence of the research

\subsection{Action Research}
To find improvements to the injury surveillance process we plan to apply a practial reasearch method, called action reasearch. The goal of action reasearch is to solve a particular problem and produce guidelines for best practice(Denscombe 2010, p.6 - wiki). In action research the researcher participates in the practiallity of performing a change to the process while simultaneously conduction research.

In our thesis we will develop a new electronoic sumission system for injury surveillance data and participate in the process where the nurses starts using it. We will obsere and interview. Iterative process. Deploy early and get feedback from the actual users of the system. It is difficult for us to understand the situation for the people actually using the system. Travel down there and. Obsere the hospital workers use the system. What do they think of it? What probelms and feedback are they having? Measure the speed before/after. Improve the system while we're there, iterations.
